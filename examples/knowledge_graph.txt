│ Sustainability: This is a single-author project in all but name — rahulnyk   │
│ authored 85% of commits, with 3 other contributors providing only 1 commit   │
│ each. The project is effectively stalled: 1 of 52 weeks active in the past   │
│ year, zero commits in the last 12 weeks, and last push 268 days ago. With no │
│ license, no releases, and a bus factor of 1, this project has no sustainable │
│ future without its sole maintainer re-engaging.                              │
│                                                                              │
│ Traction: 2,483 stars and 422 forks are strong numbers for an 839-day-old    │
│ tutorial-style project, reflecting the wave of interest in knowledge graphs  │
│ and RAG during 2024. The 31 watchers against 2,483 stars (1.2% ratio)        │
│ suggests viral/social-media-driven discovery rather than deep ongoing        │
│ interest — people starred and moved on. The fork-to-star ratio of 17% is     │
│ typical for educational repos people clone to experiment with.               │
│                                                                              │
│ Maturity: No license, no releases, no versioning, and a community health     │
│ score of 28% — this is a personal experiment that went viral, not a          │
│ maintained project. The absence of a license is particularly notable:        │
│ technically, no one has legal permission to use, modify, or distribute this  │
│ code.                                                                        │
│                                                                              │
│ Technical Assessment                                                         │
│                                                                              │
│ The repository is a Jupyter notebook prototype (90.4% notebook, 9.6%         │
│ Python), not a software project. The core deliverable is a single notebook   │
│ (extract_graph.ipynb) that chains text chunking, LLM-based concept           │
│ extraction via Ollama/Mistral, and graph construction — a straightforward    │
│ pipeline with no tests, no package structure, and no API. The presence of    │
│ pyproject.toml, poetry.lock, environment.yml, and a dockerfile shows some    │
│ environment discipline, but the .github directory and detected CI/CD likely  │
│ amount to minimal configuration rather than a real test/build pipeline. The  │
│ README is substantive and educational — it explains what knowledge graphs    │
│ are, outlines the method with a flowchart, and sets honest expectations      │
│ about the approach (local LLM, no GPT dependency). There is no hype          │
│ detected, and the claims are proportional to what a single notebook can      │
│ deliver. The old_notebooks directory and ner.ipynb suggest iterative         │
│ experimentation rather than engineered software.                             │
│                                                                              │
│ Risk Assessment                                                              │
│                                                                              │
│ Maintenance: With zero activity in 3+ months, 19 open issues, and a single   │
│ maintainer who has disengaged, adoption risk is high. Anyone building on     │
│ this will immediately become their own maintainer.                           │
│                                                                              │
│ Credibility: The README is honest about scope — this is a demonstration, not │
│ a production system. No inflated claims detected. The project does what it   │
│ says: converts text to a knowledge graph using a local LLM.                  │
│                                                                              │
│ Operational: The missing license is a blocking legal risk — forks and        │
│ derivative works have no explicit permission grant. No versioned releases    │
│ means no stability contract. Anyone integrating this must pin to a specific  │
│ commit and accept that upstream is effectively dead.                         │
│                                                                              │

│ This project provides a Jupyter notebook pipeline that splits a PDF corpus   │
│ into text chunks, extracts concepts and semantic relationships from each     │
│ chunk using a locally-hosted Mistral 7B model via Ollama, and constructs a   │
│ knowledge graph where nodes are concepts and edges represent either          │
│ LLM-extracted relationships or contextual co-occurrence within chunks. The   │
│ graph is visualized using Python graph libraries (NetworkX/pyvis) and        │
│ exported as an interactive HTML page. It is a proof-of-concept for Graph     │
│ Retrieval Augmented Generation (GRAG) that runs entirely on local hardware   │
│ with no external API costs.                                                  │
│                                                                              │
│ Verdict                                                                      │

│ A well-explained educational notebook that earned its stars as a timely      │
│ RAG-era tutorial, but the absence of a license, tests, releases, and any     │
│ recent activity makes it a reference to learn from rather than a dependency  │
│ to build on.                                                                 │
